Hello! My name is Jaime Diaz, I'm from Hatillo, Puerto Rico. 
I'm 19 years old.
I like to play sports, mainly Basketball, love soccer but unfortunetly don't play it.
My hobbies are going to the gym, spend time on YouTube and be social and with friends.
I'm currently studying in the Holberton Puerto Rico full time program, I wish to get as much of this expirience as posible.
Just an FYI, I'm very passionate when it comes to sports, get on my side and you will be fine. Visca el Barca.
